What is Points?
-----------------
Points is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. The Points platform also lets anyone create assets (tokens) on the Points network. Assets can be used for NFTs, STOs, Gift Cards, and fractional ownership of anything of value. Points uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
License

Points Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/JustAResearcher/Points/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Points Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------
Points Core is dedicated to ensure all new updates that are released will be thoroughly tested before entering the mainnet, this is why we have a testnet running alongside our main chain. While the testnet is running we will regularly run unit_testing that is built into Points Core and ensure all reports come back as PASSED.


### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
